# airfile

> Painlessly transfer files from a web browser to your local machine.

Airfile was designed specifically to make it easier to get data off my android
phone to my laptop without needing a native application.

## Usage

In a directory of your choosing, run `airfile`:

```
> airfile
Listening on 192.168.0.123:8400
```

Point your phone's web browser to this address. You'll be greeted with an
interface that lets you select files from your phone and send them.

These files are sent one by one to your local machine, saving them locally.

## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/) installed, run

```
$ npm install --global airfile
```
